Introduction
------------

These programs are relatively simple utility programs for reading and
manipulating IRIG 106 format data files.  They are run from a command line
and are invoked with various command line parameters.  Run just the command
with no parameters to get a brief summary of available command line parameters.


I106STAT
--------

Generate a summary of data channels and message types found in an IRIG 106
data file.

Usage: i106stat <input file> <output file> [flags]
   <filename> Input/output file names
   -r         Log both sides of RT to RT transfers
   -v         Verbose


I106TRIM
--------

Trim a data file based on start and/or stop time. It is assumed the day is the
same as the starting day.  If the stop time is less than the start time, it is
assumed that the time spans midnight. In this case stop time is the next day.

There are some new requirements for modifying or adding TMATS records when
rewriting data files. This utility makes no attempt to modify TMATS and so
technically my result in a non-IRIG106 compliant data file.

Usage: i106trim <infile> <outfile> [+hh:mm:ss] [-hh:mm:ss]
  +hh:mm:ss - Start copy time
  -hh:mm:ss - Stop copy time
Or:    fftrim <infile> to get stats


IDMPTMATS
---------

Read and print out the TMATS record in various formats

Usage: idmptmat <infile> <outfile> <flags>
  -c      Output channel summary format (default)
  -t      Output tree view format
  -r      Output raw TMATS


IDMP1553
--------

Read and dump 1553 messages in a humanly readable format. With no command line
parameters, all 1553 messages are dumped.  Output can be filtered by Channel ID, 
RT number, T/R bit, and Subaddress number.  Output can be further limited by
a decimation factor, useful for thing like INS data.

Usage: idmp1553 <input file> <output file> [flags]
   <filename> Input/output file names
   -v         Verbose
   -c ChNum   Channel Number (default all)
   -r RT      RT Address(1-30) (default all)
   -t T/R     T/R Bit (0=R 1=T) (default all)
   -s SA      Subaddress (default all)
   -d Num     Dump 1 in 'Num' messages
   -i         Dump data as decimal integers
   -u         Dump status response

   -T         Print TMATS summary and exit

The output data fields are:
  Time Bus RT T/R SA WC Errs Data...

Error Bits:
  0x01    Word Error
  0x02    Sync Error
  0x04    Word Count Error
  0x08    Response Timeout
  0x10    Format Error
  0x20    Message Error
  0x80    RT to RT
